# @quantinuum/quantinuum-ui
Quantinuum design tokens and React components.

Based on [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), an opinionated tailwind theme and radix-ui component generator. Shadcn components have been generated into this repo using the `components.json` definition and re-exported as a new library.

### Development

#### Basic commands
```bash
npm run storybook # Run storybook application to view components.
npm run build-storybook # Build storybook application as static HTML.
npm run build # Build component library with rollup.
```


### Design Tokens
CSS variables are declared in `src/tokens.css`. Dark mode is enabled when using the attribute `data-theme="dark"` higher up in the DOM tree. See `src/tokens.css` for more details.
